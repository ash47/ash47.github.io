<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>This is a landing page for my GitHub projects that are hosted on here.</p>

<h3>They Are Billions Level Editor</h3>
<p>You can find it <a href="https://ash47.github.io/TheyAreBillionsModKit/MapEditorHtml/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>This is a web browser based level editor for "They Are Billions". The developer actively tries to block custom maps, so the level editor will potentially not work, however, it will still work for older versions of the game.</p>
<p>Simply upload a "They Are Billions" save file, or use the template map that is available on the site.</p>

<h3>Octogeddon Save File Editor</h3>
<p>You can find it <a href="https://ash47.github.io/OctogeddonHacks/SaveEditor/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I reverse engineered the save file format for Octogeddon and wrote a browser based editor for it.</p>
<p>Simply upload your Octogeddon save file and the editor will allow you to fully edit all attributes.</p>

<h3>AI Experiments</h3>
<p>I created a whole bunch of Experimental games to explore AI. There is a dedicated landing page for these <a href="https://ash47.github.io/AiExperiments/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
